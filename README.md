PowerShell Scripts

Prerequisites
For AWS resources, the AWS CLI needs to be installed on the local machine of the person executing the scripts.  Also, AWS Tools for PowerShell (see references) needs to be installed, and the modules being used by the scripts need to be installed (no admin rights needed if installed under current user context).

Copy PSScriptFunctions.psm1 to C:\Users\AbdallahMwita\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PSScriptFunctions
For GitHub scripts, PSGraphQL module needs to be installed (no admin rights needed).  You should also install the Chrome Extension:  “GraphQL Playground for Chrome”.  This will give you a GUI to experiment with different queries, and also provides read-ahead syntax assistance when building your queries.
